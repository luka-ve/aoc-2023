# Advent of Code 2022

Hi and welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022! This year's solutions are written in Python, including some lightweight infrastructure around creating and running puzzle solutions. Enjoy! :)

## How to use this repo:

To create a day run `create_day.py`, followed by the day you want to create. It will create the directory and a set of empty files. If no arguments are given, today's day will be created.

To run a day, run `run.py`, followed by a space-separated list of integers for the days you want to run. If left empty, it will run all days it can find. You can find additional arguments to the runner in the respective file.
